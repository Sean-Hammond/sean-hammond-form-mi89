# Basic Form Styled with Bootsrap

To try to improve my Boostrap skills, I made this HTML form trying to use more Bootstrap than CSS. I later created another version with almost no CSS (see my other repositories!).

## How to View the Site

Since this is a very simple site, I might not have it deployed to view on the web. Instead, you can see this site live by running a web-server using the following command:

```bash
$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```
