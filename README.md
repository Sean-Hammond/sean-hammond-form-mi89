# Basic Form Styled with Bootsrap

To try to improve my Boostrap skills, I tried to style this HTML form using almost entirely Bootstrap instead of CSS!

## How to View the Site

Since this is a very simple site, I might not have it deployed to view on the web. Instead, you can see this site live by running a web-server using the following command:

```bash
$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```
## What I Learned

In Bootstrap, sometimes it's easier to use a class of w-50 instead of wrapping into a row and giving a class of col-6. But w must be in increments of 25 (w-90 does not work).
